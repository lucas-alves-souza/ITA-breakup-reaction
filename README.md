# ITA breakup reaction code

ITA breakup reaction code: This project aims the development of reaction code to study the breakup of compound projectiles. We currently can provide cross section for elastic and non-elastic breakup modes.


This code is performed to compute the breakup of 3He on two heavy targets, 93Nb and 197Au in:

and in calculations of inclusive ${\alpha}$ particle production to interpret reaction experimental data induced by the two-neutron halo $^6$He and the isotopes $^{6,7}$Li on different target nuclei:

Main code created by Prof. Brett Carlson. 
Emanuel V. Chimanski and Lucas A. Souza collaborate with the project.
